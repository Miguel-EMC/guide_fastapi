Welcome to my collection of guides and example projects for various backend frameworks! The purpose of this repository is to provide clear, concise documentation alongside functional code examples.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each framework has its own directory, which is divided into two parts:

-   `guide/`: Contains the documentation and theoretical explanations.
-   `example_project/`: Contains a complete and functional code project.
